        <p>Before starting a new game, it is recommended to launch the game in offline mode to avoid other players
            messing
            up your run. Just make sure that 'Offline Mode' appears at the top-left corner of the menu screen.</p>

        <p>Once you made sure you're in offline mode, you're ready to face the challenge.</p>
        <p>Firstly, make your character: you're going to pick the sorcerer class and the healing wares starting gift.
            This run can be done with any other class.</p>
        <p>Once your character is done, head to Majula. From here you will go to Heide's Tower of Flame and defeat the
            Dragonrider boss. After that, go up the tower you're in and talk to Licia of Lindelt until she starts
            repeating
            herself. You then go back to Majula.</p>
        <p>Next is passing through the Forest of Fallen Giants to reach the Cardinal Tower bonfire. Buy a Soul Arrow
            from
            Melentia, the merchant, for 1500 souls. From there, go down the ladder, grab the Great Soul Arrow and defeat
            the
            Last Giant to get the Soldier's Key. You need it to open the door leading to the Pursuer boss fight. After
            beating him, you now travel to the Lost Bastille with the help of a giant crow.</p>
        <p>At the Lost Bastille, take a turn left and pick up the Fragrant Branch of Yore. You use it to unlock the
            door to
            the Ruins Sentinels boss. After fighting them, get through Sinner's Rise and fight the Last Sinner, which is
            the
            last boss of this area. Once you defeat her, head through the door and go back to Majula by igniting the
            Primal
            bonfire at the end of the hall.</p>
        <p>In Majula, buy a Fragrant Branch of Yore from Melentia for 12000 souls. You also need to buy the Silver Cat
            Ring
            and a Lloyd's Talisman from Sweet Shalquoir, the cat, for 13400 souls. You can also buy the mace from
            Lenigrast,
            the blacksmith, for 1200 souls. The branch is needed to access the switch opening the door leading to the
            Shaded
            Woods, while the ring is needed to jump down the pit in Majula.</p>
        <p>Equip the Silver Cat Ring, remove your armours and weapons, and then slowly walk into the pit. When you get
            to
            the bottom, you can quickly rush through the Gutter area to get to Black Gulch. Here you need to defeat the
            Rotten and then travel back to Majula.</p>
        <p>Back in Majula, go to the back to where you came from after creating your character and go right until you
            reach
            a door. Use the Fragrant Branch of Yore to open it and enter the Shaded Woods.</p>
        <p>Once you're in the Shaded Woods, just keep running straight, since the visibility there is low. Grab the
            Clear
            Bluestone Ring and Chloranthy Ring right at the end of the fog. When you can finally see clearly again, head
            up
            to the Ruined Fork Road.</p>
        <p>Pick the right path to get to the Scorpioness Najka boss in the Shaded Ruins. After defeating her, pick up
            the
            Homing Soul Mass spell inside the chest to your right and go straight through the Door of Pharros area.</p>
        <p>You're now in Brightstone Cove Tseldora. Go left until you reach the ruins of a house: inside you will find
            a
            mimic pretending to be a treasure chest. Use your Lloyd's Talisman on the mimic to get the Staff of Wisdom,
            which is the best for spells. You can also take the Soul Vortex spell located behind the mimic. After that
            defeat the Duke's Dear Freja and head back to the Ruined Fork Road.</p>
        <p>From there, go to the path on the left this time and go through the Shrine of Winter. Just follow the path
            until
            you get to Drangleic Castle.</p>
        <p>You're more than halfway through the game. In Drangleic Castle, pick up the Soul Greatsword spell next to
            the
            bonfire and head on to the Shrine of Amana. This is one of the hardest areas of the game, so take it slowly
            and
            use your spells to defeat the enemies one-by-one. Don't forget to pick up the Crystal Homing Soul Mass spell
            along the way. It is located to your left when you enter the area. After passing through, you arrive in the
            Undead Crypt.</p>
        <p>It is an easy area so there isn't much to explain. You get to the end of it and talk to king Vendrick. He
            gives
            you the King's Ring, which is needed to open certain doors. Teleport back to the Ruined Fork Road with the
            bonfire.</p>
        <p>Take the middle path this time, which leads you through Aldia's Keep. Pick up the Soul Geyser spell along
            the
            way and defeat the Guardian Dragon. Next you arrive at Dragon Aerie. This is a dangerous area, but you can
            skip
            it entirely with the help of the ziplines.</p>
        <p>After passing through, you reach the Dragon Shrine. Here you need to talk to the Ancient Dragon to get the
            Ashen
            Mist Heart, which is needed to access the memory of a giant. You then travel back to Majula.</p>
        <p>You go to the Cardinal Tower once again, but instead of going down the ladder, you open the huge door to the
            Place Unbeknownst by equipping the King's Ring. There's a giant that looks like a tree, whom you can examine
            with the Ashen Mist Heart to enter its memories. Here you will need to fight its memory. Once you succeed,
            you
            are now almost at the finish line.</p>
        <p>Teleport to Drangleic Castle from Majula and enter the Throne of Want with the help of the King's Ring. You
            will
            need to defeat the Throne Watcher and Defender and then Nashandra. If you manage to win, just go through the
            portal and the credits will start to roll. You must not skip the credits or else you won't get the special
            ring.
            When the credits are done, you appear back in Majula with the ring in your inventory.</p>
        <p>Congratulations, you cleared the game without your character dying!</p>
