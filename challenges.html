        <p>If you're interested in challenging yourself even more, you could try completing both no-death and no-bonfire
            runs at the same time. This saves you time if you want both rings, but it is very challenging.
            You could also speed up your no-death run by doing a certain tricky jump: it would save you a lot of time,
            but
            you would have to restart if you fail.
            The jump is worth the risk, since it's very early in the game and you won't lose too much if you need to
            restart.
            To set up the jump, you first need to talk to Crestfallen Sulden in Majula and join the Way of the Blue
            covenant. This gives you the Blue Seal, which is a ring that increases your maximum health points by 3%.
            You then need to go to Heide's Tower of Flame and just run to the boss arena. You can make the boss fall
            into
            the water by waiting for it to take 7 steps and then quickly running to the other end of the ring. This gets
            you
            enough souls to increase your character's Vigor to 15, which gives your character 1068 health points.
            Lastly, you need to get to the Cardinal Tower, past the Forest of Fallen Giants, to get the Life Ring from a
            chest behind a hidden door. This raises your maximum health points by 5%.
            The two rings and your 15 Vigor should put your character at 1155 health points, which is enough to survive
            the
            jump.
            You now need to go through the door behind the Cardinal Tower bonfire, where you will see a ledge. Drop down
            on
            the platform below and take care of the 2 monsters waiting there. Go right and keep going until you reach
            the
            edge of the platform. You should now remove your character's armours and weapons, but not the rings, because
            weight increases fall damage.
            From the edges of the platform, go backwards until your back is against a pillar. You then face the hill in
            front of you with the camera, run up to the edge and jump by keeping the jump button pressed for one or two
            seconds.
            This jump lets you skip the entirety of the Lost Bastille.
